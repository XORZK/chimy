## why c?
*chimy* is a project I've been working on for a while now. While originally created in C++, recently, I've decided to rewrite it in C. Going backwards a little bit, I know. 

I wanted a more complete understanding of memory management, and low level programming. Start from the bottom and work my way up. I didn't want everything to be handed to me, and so instead of using pre-written libraries containing pre-written data structures and algorithms, I wrote 99% of the code utilized in the renderer myself.
