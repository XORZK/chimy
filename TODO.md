# TODO
- Generic list in C (IMPORTANT) [DONE]
- Convex Hull
	- Polygon is complex or not --> intersection of segments using Bentley-Ottmann?
		- Requires Priority Queue (HEAP) [ DONE ] and BST [ DONE ]
- Polygon Triangulation [ DONE ]
	- Very simple
	- Visualization program could use some work
- Perspective Projection [DONE]
- Bezier Curves
- Vertex Transformations:
	- Translation, Rotation, Scaling
- Projections:
	- 3D coordinates to 2D screen coordinates
	- Perspective/orthographic projection
	- NDC to Screen Space
- Triangle Rasterization
	- Bounding Box Optimization?
- Barycentric Coordinates
- k-d tree
- Depth Interpolation (Z-Buffer)
- Normal Interpolation for Shading
- Shading and Lighting Models
- Texture Mapping
- Bilinear Filtering
- Camera System (Viewing from different angles)
- Something with Graphs?
- AutoCAD Software
